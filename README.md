# 👋 Hey, I'm Russell Butler  
### Backend Developer • Tech Strategist • Digital Systems Builder

I build clean, scalable backend systems and digital products that help people and businesses run smarter.  
Python. FastAPI. Automation. Smart Tech. Local-first digital ecosystems.

I’m over 50, still leveling up, and I’m proving in real time that anyone can reinvent themselves with discipline, curiosity, and modern tools.
